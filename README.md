# ComWatch
A simple project to check if there is an outdated composer package by browser (WIP)

## Installation
Checkout this repository and run
```
composer install
```

Or add composer to your project
```
composer require composer/composer
```
And include checkPackages.php in the root of your project.

## Usage
At the moment you should run this script in your browser, go to http://example.com/checkPackages.php

That's it.

## Need to build:
 - Better interface
 - Ability to check multiple projects at once
 
## Improvments
 If you have improvements, fork this repository and make a pull request.
